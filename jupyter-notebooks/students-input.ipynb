    "Report for Part-A can be generated starting from a collection of Jupyter notebooks placed online on a github repository. We suggest to explitly refer to the github page in the report. This suggestion is motivated by the wish to make our science <b>reproducible</b>. The collection of notebooks will have a main page connected by hyperlinks to a set of supporting pages. \n",
